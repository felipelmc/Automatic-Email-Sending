# Automatic Email Sending
Simple code implementing a way of sending e-mails through Python using SMTP. Remember that, in order to use this code, you must have a Google account. More specifically, you must enable the two-step verification and then generate an app password [here](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords?rapt=AEjHL4NJ5E1G-KEq_PCcN0WizW6Y5Tu_YrYMJUF8aHonAUgziK1xClzFIIvINDAD9o_gQ2zOlgq-uMLIJkOzdc7KxcN4ZWoWGQ).

Please keep in mind that **this code is NOT meant to be used for spamming purposes**, which is actually a crime in many countries and violates Google's terms of service. This is just a simple code to show how to send e-mails using Python.
